# Auto_ML_app
This application trains  ML algorithms on custom datasets and returns model metrics

## [Heroku live app](https://shankar-regressor.herokuapp.com/)


## Motivation
Having a GUI to see model performance as model parameters are tuned helps identify the optimal model for the dataset. This can be used for downstream tasks like prediction

## Future scope of work
Returning the predictions obtained from customized model after uploading new unseen dataset
